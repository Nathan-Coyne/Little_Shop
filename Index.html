            <img src="img/profile_pic.jpg" align="left" alt="" class="aboutMe__img">
            <p class="aboutMe__content">I grew up in a lovely countryside in Germany, in a big, wild garden,
                which was surrounded by even more untamed nature. It was then, that I discovered 
                my love for anything related to fantasy. Secret fairy gardens, hidden forests full 
                of magic and unexplored caves with enchanted treasures. My imagination was endless 
                and I started writing, drawing and sculpting as soon as I entered school.
                Later, as an adult, I moved to a bigger city, but my love for creativity 
                and magic was unbroken.
                Soon I started creating jewellery - first by experimenting with oven baked clay 
                such as Fimo and Sculpey, followed by beading and wirewrapping, and finally I 
                started working with metal and resin.
                I think it was 2011, when I first started selling my creations on conventions 
                and markets all over the country. Only very small amounts first, way too cheap and in a 
                corner on a table, which a friend booked to sell her own items.
                As I became more confident in my skills, I started booking my own tables and I was so
                happy to see that my jewellery was well received and made people happy.
                I recently moved from Germany to the UK and decided to offer my creations online, 
                to make them available to ...</p>

            <h1 class="FAQ__heading">FAQ</h1>
            
            <p class="FAQ__question"> Q: Do you also make custom orders, 
                different from what is posted here?</p>

            <p class="FAQ__answer-1">A: Yes. Just send me an email and we'll discuss your idea.</p>
                    
            <p class="FAQ__question">Q: I'm allergic to nickel. What 
                material do you use for your jewellery?</p>

            <p class="FAQ__answer">A: Resin and metal. The metal I'm using 
                is brass and should be lead and nickel safe. If you have a nickel allergy 
                though, for a small additional charge I 
                can replace the brass ear hooks with either sterling silver or stainless steel. 
                At this point however, I can't offer this service for necklaces or rings yet.</p>
                    
            <p class="FAQ__question">Q: I've seen a piece, which is already sold, 
                but I really wanted it. 
            Can you make the same one again?</p>

            <p class="FAQ__answer">A: In most cases yes. Just drop me an email 
                and I'll have a look if I
                have all materials in stock to reproduce it.</p>
                    
            <p class="FAQ__question">   Q: Do you ship worldwide?</p>

            <p class="FAQ__answer">    A: Right now I'm shipping to the UK, Germany and Austria. If 
                you live somewhere else and want to place an order, please email me 
                first, so that I can look up your countries shipping laws. Some countries 
                for example, don't allow me to ship jewellery there, which contains natural 
                shell or dried moss etc.</p>
